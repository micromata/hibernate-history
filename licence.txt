The license of Hibernate History

When software is released to the public, it must be provided under a license. There are numerous licenses to choose from: Public domain, GPL, LGPL, BSD, Apache, Eclipse Public, Mozilla Public and the WTFPL license. Choosing the right license for this software requires great patience and insight regarding legal jargon.

In the end, the 3-clause BSD license was chosen for Hibernate History. The 3-clause BSD (also called the BSD-new or revised BSD) is a variant of the original BSD license. The variant uses only – as the name implies – three major clauses from the original clause. These three clauses state that software under the BSD license may be used freely as well as copied, modified and distributed. The fourth clause of the original BSD is called the "advertising clause"; which does not apply in this case. It requires software developers of all works derived from BSD licensed software to name and acknowledge the original source explicitly. The only condition of the BSD license is that the copyright notice of the original program must not be removed. Thus, the BSD software license is also suitable for commercial software products. In sum, the BSD license contains a general disclaimer and explicitly identifies the author. Further, it can be used, copied, modified and redistributed freely, for commercial and non-commercial purposes.
